# Gutenberg Blocks!
Playing around with building blocks for Gutenberg!  Some of these work, some of them don't - I'm experimenting with a bunch of weird, different things to get some footing on the Gutenberg landscape.

So far, this includes the following Blocks:
- Editable Content
- Editable Content Multiline
- Editable Content Alignment
- Editable Content with Media Upload
- Editable Content as a Fifty Fifty Block
- Editable Content as a Fifty Fifty Block with an Option (which does nothing but adds a class to the parent container)
- Editable Content with Conditional Fields
- Editable Content with a Repeater (not working)
